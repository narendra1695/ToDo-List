## Introduction

This website is an small example of how powerful jQuery could be to add strong functionalities.

## Working

Using the concepts of jQuery, this project demonstrated that instead of using long-lines of codes with Vanilla-JS for DOM manipulations, on can simply use jQuery. 
The syntax migh be a little overwhelming at first, but as soon as you get the gist of it, it will be a piece of cake and you would not want to go back to Vanilla-JS.
